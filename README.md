## 🔒 Built with OpenZeppelin Contracts

The smart contracts in this project are built using the [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/) library to ensure security, modularity, and upgradability.

## 🧭 How to Run

This project uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and a custom `Makefile` for a smoother development experience.  
Just run `make <task>` without remembering long commands!

### 📦 1. Install Foundry

If you haven’t installed Foundry yet:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 📁 2. Clone Repository

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/NusaHub/smart-contract
> cd smart-contract
```

### 🔨 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
> make build
```

### 🧪 4. Run Test

```bash
> make test
```

### 🎯 5. Deploy and Verify Contracts

```bash
> make deploy
```

## 🔐 .env Configuration

Before running deploy or verification commands, make sure your `.env` file is properly set up in the root directory.

```env
# 🔑 Private key of your deployer wallet (NEVER share this)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# 🌐 RPC URL of the target network
RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com

# 🛡️ Set verifier type: "etherscan" or "blockscout"
VERIFIER=blockscout

# 🔗 Custom verifier URL (needed for blockscout)
VERIFIER_URL=https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/api/
```
